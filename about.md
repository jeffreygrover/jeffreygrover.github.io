My name is Jeffrey Grover, and I'm a physicist by training.

I studied physics and math at <a href="https://www.amherst.edu" target="_blank">Amherst College</a>, where I wrote an undergraduate honors thesis with <a href="https://www.amherst.edu/~jrfriedman" target="_blank">Jonathan Friedman</a>. 
After that I completed a PhD in experimental atomic physics in the <a href="http://jqi.umd.edu/" target="_blank">Joint Quantum Institute</a> at the <a href="http://umdphysics.umd.edu/" target="_blank">University of Maryland</a>. 
My advisors were <a href="http://groups.jqi.umd.edu/rolston/" target="_blank">Steve Rolston</a> and <a href="http://www.physics.umd.edu/rgroups/amo/orozco/" target="_blank">Luis Orozco</a>, and we tried to laser-cool and trap rubidium atoms a few microns away from a superconducting circuit inside a dilution refrigerator. It was a crazy idea.

I'm currently a postdoc in the <a href="http://equs.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Engineering Quantum Systems Group</a> within the <a href="http://www.rle.mit.edu/" target="_blank">RLE</a> at <a href="http://web.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT</a>.
We're trying to build a quantum computer out of superconducting devices.
It involves a lot of RF circuit design, quantum physics, and programming in Python.

More recently I've become a data scientist convert, since playing with other people's data is rather fun.
I like learning about and applying machine learning algorithms, as well as beautiful visualization tools.
You can learn more about my data (and physics) projects <a href="">here</a>.

Once upon a time I was also the goalkeeper for the (<a href="http://www.ncaa.com/news/soccer-men/article/2015-12-05/diii-mens-soccer-amherst-comes-behind-win-first-title-school" target="_blank">2015 National Champion!</a>) <a href="http://athletics.amherst.edu/sports/msoc/index" target="_blank">Amherst College Men's Soccer Team</a>.
I still play when I can, even if I'm far less agile than I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtWODs15Ts0" target="_blank">once was</a>.
